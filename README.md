Given m machines and n jobs, each with a weight of $w_i$, the machines have the ability to determine the completion times of jobs. 

The collaborative objective of machines is to "minimize the finish time of the last job." 

Jobs select machines based on the shortest finish time, influenced by the number of jobs choosing the same machine.



Ultimately, this dynamic leads to an equilibrium where there is a distribution of jobs to machines, and no job desires to change its selection. 

My thesis introduces an algorithm capable of computing a strategy for the machines to achieve one equilibrium, which ensures an optimal outcome, from the perspective of the collaborative machines.
